# MILP_Differential_MGFN
This repository contains the programs for differential characteristic search for MGFN ciphers.

## Introduction
1. The SBox.py file is run to generate all convex packet inequalities for the S-box, and the run requires configuration of the python and sagemath environments.

2. Running the inequality2vector.py file refines the set of inequalities generated by SBox.py by means of a greedy algorithm.

3. MGFN_Diff_Iterate.py file to run on the MGFN cipher for any number of rounds of differential characteristic search, which can be constrained by the Init function on whether it is an iterative differential characteristic search, the default setting is now an iterative differential search. For solving the MILP modeling lp file we use the Gurobi solver.
